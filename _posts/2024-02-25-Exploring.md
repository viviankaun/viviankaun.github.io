Users can directly browse the pdf file context directly online. 

1. Once we upload the pdf format file, it automatically generates images to our file system from pdf files. Users can directly browse the pdf file context online without downloading the pdf file to the userâ€™s local.
2. When we delete our original pdf record, it also removes related images from our file system.
